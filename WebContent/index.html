	<h1>Welcome to Atlas.</h1>
	<h3><em>the world's first timestamp-based listening service</em></h3>

		<p>Whether it's the <a href="https://youtu.be/sE7xyn28wjg?t=40" target="_blank">beat drop

		specifically, some moment.</p>

	<div id="cherry">
	 	<h2>At Atlas, we live in that moment - also known as a cherry.</h2>
		<p>Cherries are those times in songs that give you goosebumps, pump your adrenaline,
		make your hairs stand on end, or all of the above.</p>
		<p>By building a network for people to share those cherries with each other, music
		discovery and enjoyment are made easier.</p>

	<div id="final">
		<h2>Because nobody has time to sit through recommendations.</h2>
		<p> So don't. Let us do the work for you. All you have to do is sit back, and listen.</p>
